# **Daily Competitive Programming Challenges** 🚀

Welcome to the **Daily Competitive Programming Challenges** repository! This initiative is designed to improve our problem-solving skills, enhance coding efficiency, and foster collaboration among students and developers.

---

## **How It Works** 🛠️

1. **Daily Problem**  
   A new coding problem will be added every day to a specific directory (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.). Each problem includes:  
   - Problem description  
   - Input and output format  
   - Example test cases  

2. **Solve and Submit**  
   - Fork this repository.  
   - Clone your fork to your local machine.  
   - Navigate to the respective day's folder, solve the problem in your preferred language, and save your solution.  
   - Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request.  

3. **Code Review**  
   - Review submissions by others to learn new approaches and provide constructive feedback.  
   - Get feedback on your solutions to improve.  

4. **Leaderboard**  
   - A weekly leaderboard will track top performers based on submissions.

   To sync future changes from this repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/CodeTogether.git
   ```

4. **Solve Problems**  
   - Check the problem in the respective day’s folder.  
   - Add your solution file in the `submissions` folder for that day. Name your file as `YourName_Language.extension`.  
     Example: `SaishPatil_CPP.cpp`.  

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
